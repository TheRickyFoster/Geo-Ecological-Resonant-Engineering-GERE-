## ‚öôÔ∏è Integrated Workflow

1. **Sensing:** Global real-time geophysical sensing feeds data to central AI systems.
2. **Analysis:** AI identifies distortion-opportunity zones.
3. **GOGW Activation:** If a trench is nearby, hydropower harvesting is initiated.
4. **BCE Deployment:** Surrounding biospheric modules cascade in sequence:
    - Foundation layer ‚Üí Stabilization layer ‚Üí Biodiversity enhancement layer.
5. **DAO Governance:** All actions governed and funded through a decentralized autonomous organization with on-chain verification and community oversight.
6. **Maintenance:** Autonomous monitoring and feedback ensures perpetual system integrity and adaptive growth.

## üåç Design Philosophy

- Biomimetic: Reflects and amplifies natural cycles.
- Autonomous: Requires minimal human intervention post-deployment.
- Modular: Adaptable to any environment globally.
- Ethical: Prioritizes ecological harmony and biodiversity.
